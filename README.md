# Project Name

Weekend-to-do-list

## Description
Duration: 3 days

For this project we had to create a weekend to do list. We created this to add in your tasks for the weekend or any day at that. The user will be able to see when the task is added and if it was completed or not. When you enter it, it will show not completed and there is a button to complete the task, and when this button is clicked it will show that completed task in green. Also, if the user will need to delete the task, there is a delete button to delete the task.
